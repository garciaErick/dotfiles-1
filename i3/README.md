i3 config files
==================

i3status
------------
By default, i3status looks for configuration files in the following order:

    ~/.config/i3status/config (or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/i3status/config if set)

    /etc/xdg/i3status/config (or $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/i3status/config if set)

    ~/.i3status.conf

    /etc/i3status.conf
    
layouts
--------------
These are the json files that have the workspace tree of saved layouts
To restore a layout use
```bash
i3-msg "append_layout /path/to/layout.json"
```
scripts
-------------
These are some script files that are called from i3's config so that it doesn't get too bloated.
